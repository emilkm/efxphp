efxphp
======

PHP server library for Action Message Format (AMF) applications, with support for AMF0 and AMF3.

The library provides a complete AMF implementation in PHP. Encoding/decoding can be sped up with a custom PHP extension https://github.com/emilkm/amfext

Extension or not, encoded output and decoded input are the same, and are OK by Adobe/Apache BlazeDS.
